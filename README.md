# RichText: The Rich Text Programming Language

## Overview

RichText is a revolutionary (and perhaps slightly unhinged) parody programming language that can **only** be written using Microsoft Word with rich text formatting. It leverages the various styling options of rich text to define the syntax and semantics of the language, resulting in code that is as visually... unique... as it is functional (in theory).

## Language Features

### Core Concepts

* **Rich Text Foundation:** The entirety of a RichText program must be authored within a Microsoft Word document using rich text formatting.
* **Mutable Variables:** Mutable variables are denoted by being formatted in **bold**.
* **Immutable Variables:** Immutable variables are represented by regular font.
* **Static Typing:** Data types are statically declared and indicated in superscript immediately following the number (e.g., `10^int`).
* **IDE Limitation:** The sole compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for RichText is Microsoft Word itself.

### Functions

* **Private Functions:** Private functions have no special rich text formatting.
* **Public Functions:** Public functions are denoted by being *underlined*.
* **Static Functions:** Static functions are represented by **bold** formatting.
* **Function Definition Layout:** Each new function definition must begin on a new page within the Word document.
* **Main Function:** The entry point of a RichText program, the `main` function, must be formatted in red text.

### Memory Management

* **Memory Deallocation:** To clear a variable from memory, its name must be formatted with strikethrough.
* **Memory Allocation Strategy:** The RichText runtime manages memory by spinning up new Windows 11 Virtual Machines using Hyper-V for each allocation.
* **Memory Clearing Mechanism:** Releasing allocated memory involves terminating (nuking) the associated Windows 11 Virtual Machine.

### Variable Scope

* **Global Variables:** Global variables are identified by having a black text shadow, offset by 1 pixel to the bottom-right with a 50% blur.
* **Thread-Local Variables:** Variables with thread-local scope are formatted in *italics*.

### Concurrency

* **Thread Creation:** A new thread is launched by inserting a paragraph break within the code.
* **Concurrency Model:** Concurrency is implemented by the RichText runtime creating and managing new Windows 11 VMs via Hyper-V (requires Windows 11 Pro).

### Code Structure and Formatting

* **Program Name:** The name of the RichText program must be center-aligned and displayed in font size 16.
* **General Code Formatting:** All code, excluding the program name, must be in font size 12.
* **Code Blocks:** Sections of code are denoted by being formatted in the Courier New font.
* **Alignment Requirement:** All executable code (excluding the program name) must be left-justified to be considered valid by the compiler.
* **Indentation:** Traditional whitespace indentation is not used. Instead, code block indentation is represented by using different levels of bulleted lists.
* **Inline Media:** Any images included within the RichText code must be inline with the text and cannot be placed on a new line.

### Communication and External Interaction

* **External Requests:** Making external requests (e.g., HTTP calls) is achieved by inserting a hyperlink to the target website directly within the code.

### Comments

* **Single-line Comments:** Single-line comments must be written in the Comic Sans font, with a font size of 11.5pt.
* **Multi-line Comments:** Multi-line comments should be formatted using the Brush Script MT font.
* **Invisible Comments:** Comments intended to be ignored by humans should have identical text and background colors, with a font size of 14.

### Error Handling

* **Console Output:** Any errors that would typically be displayed in a console will instead be printed using the Wingdings font.
* **Compile Error Location:** Compile errors are not shown in a standard output but must be located manually by examining the Windows Event Viewer.
* **Execution Environment Restriction:** The RichText compiler will refuse to compile code if it detects it is running within a non-Windows 11 bare metal environment, throwing a "gitgud exception." Compilation within Windows VMs is permitted.

### Version Control

* **Supported VCS:** The only officially supported version control system for RichText projects is Microsoft OneDrive.

### Localization

* **Locale Sensitivity:** The RichText compiler is sensitive to the system's locale settings (e.g., English, French, German), potentially affecting compilation.
* **Regional Dialect Sensitivity:** Code written in different regional dialects of the same language (e.g., American English vs. British English) may not compile identically. For instance, using "km" in British English code will result in a compile error.

### Syntax Highlighting

* **Manual Highlighting:** Syntax highlighting in RichText must be performed manually by the programmer using Microsoft Word's highlighter pen tool.

### Web Development

* **Compiled Website Compatibility:** Websites "compiled" with RichText are only guaranteed to function correctly when opened in Microsoft Edge.
* **Legacy Browser Support:** Some RichText features may only be compatible when Microsoft Edge is running in Internet Explorer Compatibility Mode.

## Disclaimer

Use of the RichText programming language may result in frustration, hair loss, and existential dread. The developers assume no responsibility for any mental anguish or productivity decline resulting from attempting to code in rich text. You have been warned.
